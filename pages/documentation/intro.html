        <p>The application is as decentralised as possible. What does that mean? Basically, most traditional web applications have all of the files/data stored on either a single server (computer), or a collection of servers that belong to a single entity. There are many problems associated with centralised applications;</p>
        <ul class="docs-list">
            <li>You have to trust them with your data.</li>
            <li>The public will have less control over how the application is managed.</li>
            <li>They will be targeted by hackers.</li>
            <li>They can be theortically shutdown by a centralised authority.</li>
            <li>They can be less flexible.</li>
            <li>They can make it harder to port data between different applications.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This application, however, does not rely on a centralised server. Instead, it uses a variety of different technologies and methods to prevent centralisation from occuring. To start with, it uses a Peer-To-Peer database engine called GunDB for exchanging and storing encrypted data. The application does not store any personal data. This data will be stored in a separate "Pod", which you can use to login to the application. You can choose which data you want to make public or private. If you want to close your account, and move to a different platform, you can do that and all of your posts, photos, contacts will go with you. Additionally, all financial transactions will be done using cryptocurrencies - using which ever wallet plugin you choose to install. The application can be extended using plugins. However, these plugins are not actually installed into the application. Instead, the application will use what called APIs to connect with third-party applications.</p>

        <p>Anyone can login and use this application. You can either login as a guest, which has limited functionality, or you can login using a WebID. Your WebID provides you with a verified identify, which complies with both KYC and AMD regulations. The application has three main revenue models: Lottery, Land Value Tax, and advertisements. The lottery and LVT are both paid into an account/address stored in a Smart Contract (or maybe separate contracts?). Each account/address will be associated with a country and post/zip code region. For example, lets say you login with your WebID, and you country of residence is England, and your post code is TQ10 XYZ. The application will automatically send your money to the address that relates to TQ10. The reason for this is because this money will get redistributed in the form of Credits to all other users in that post code.</p>

        <p>We live in a polarized society. Some people want this, and others want that. Yet we have failed to deliver a system which allows people to choose how they want to live their lives – an argument that has been presented by Libertarians for many years.</p>
        <p> As it currently stands, all we really have is Socialism. While there are many good ideas associated with Socialism, it comes with many bad ideas too. Socialism (according to Google) is a system which advocates that the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole. While this might sound like a good idea, it is, and has proven to be, very problematic.</p>

        <p>I won't go into the details now, but instead I would like to propose an alternative. What if, instead of collectivizing the means of production, we collectivized things which are NOT the means of production? That way, we do not have to violate anybody's property rights. Land, for example, is not the means of production. Nobody built the land. We can therefore use a Land Value Tax as the primary form of revenue.</p>

        <p>This application uses a form of Land Value Tax, although it is not technically a tax. By that I mean, we collectively buy back the land, and then residents can rent the land from the community, which provides the tax revenue, which we can also use to buy more land, and so on.</p>
