<h3>Cryptocurrencies</h3>

<p>The application only uses cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies are a decentralised form of money. Below is a screenshot which can help you understand the difference between a centralised network, and a decentralised one. </p>

<p>Given that there are many cryptocurrencies to choose from, and there will likely be many more to come, all prices are priced in IDX (Average Currency Value). IDX represents the average value of the 20 most popular cryptocurrencies â€“ similar to the Crypto-backed index fund, Crypto20. </p>
<p>You will be able to plug-in any wallet you want from the plugins page. In the settings page, you can set a default currency.</p>
